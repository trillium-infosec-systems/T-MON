# **Challenge 3: Checking Network Ports on a Linux System**

---

### **Description:**

🔍 As a Level 1 SOC Analyst, you have been asked to investigate a potentially compromised Linux system. You want to check which processes are listening on open network ports. The command to list open network ports and their associated processes is:

```bash
netstat -tulpn
```

🤔 Question:

Which command would you use to filter the output to show only processes listening on TCP port 80?

🔘 a) ```netstat -tulpn | grep ":80"``` 🔘 b) ```netstat -tulpn | findstr "80"``` 🔘 c) ```netstat -tulpn | awk '/:80/'``` 🔘 d) ```netstat -tulpn | grep "tcp.*:80"```

💡 Hint: Consider the port protocol while filtering the output.
