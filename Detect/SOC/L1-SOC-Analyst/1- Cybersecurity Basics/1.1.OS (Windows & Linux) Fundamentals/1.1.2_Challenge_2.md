### **Description:**

🔍 You are a Level 1 SOC Analyst, and you have been asked to analyze a log file on a Linux system. You need to display the last 50 lines of a log file named syslog located in /var/log. The command to display the last 50 lines of the log file is:

```bash
tail -50 /var/log/syslog
```

🤔 Question:

Which command would you use to search for occurrences of the word "error" in the last 50 lines of the log file?

🔘 a) ```tail -50 /var/log/syslog | grep "error"``` 🔘 b) ```tail -50 /var/log/syslog | findstr "error"``` 🔘 c) ```grep "error" /var/log/syslog | tail -50``` 🔘 d) ```grep -50 "error" /var/log/syslog```

💡 Hint: Remember the common Linux commands used to filter and search within logs.
