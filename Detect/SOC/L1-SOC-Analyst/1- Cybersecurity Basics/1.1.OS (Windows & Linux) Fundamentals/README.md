# 1.1 OS (Windows & Linux) Fundamentals

## Introduction
For an L1 SOC Analyst, mastering the fundamentals of operating systems, specifically Windows and Linux, is paramount. This knowledge base aids analysts in swiftly detecting, analyzing, and responding to potential security threats on these systems. This module offers challenges and insights into commonly faced threats and the investigative commands and tools that can be employed.

## Objectives
- Understand essential commands used in Windows and Linux for security investigations.
- Differentiate between normal and suspicious system behavior.
- Enhance analytical skills to investigate potentially compromised systems.

## Challenges
Engage with the following challenges to sharpen your OS investigative skills. It's recommended to approach these challenges without referencing solutions for an authentic learning experience.

1. [Investigating a potentially compromised Windows system](./1.1.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Analyzing a log file on a Linux system](./1.1.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Checking processes listening on open network ports on Linux](./1.1.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Checking for failed login attempts on a Windows system](./1.1.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Listing top CPU consuming processes on Linux](./1.1.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While the challenges cover the fundamentals of Windows and Linux OS, it's essential to delve deeper. Continuously update yourself on the latest OS-specific threats and mitigation techniques. Participate in OS-specific forums, communities, and workshops.

## Reproducing Challenges
For a hands-on experience:

- Use virtual environments like VirtualBox or VMware to replicate Windows and Linux OS scenarios safely.
- Familiarize yourself with in-built tools like `wmic`, `wevtutil` for Windows, and `ps`, `netstat` for Linux.
- Simulate threat scenarios and practice investigative commands.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit:

- **General Tools**:
  - Platforms like `CyberRange` and `Hack The Box` offer real-world challenges.
  - Master native OS tools and commands that assist in quick investigations.
  
- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - For Windows: Command-line tools like `wmic`, `wevtutil`.
  - For Linux: Commands like `ps`, `netstat`, `grep`, and `awk` are invaluable.
