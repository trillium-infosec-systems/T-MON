---

### **Description:**

🔍 As a Level 1 SOC Analyst, you are analyzing a Linux system for suspicious activities. It's crucial to understand the system's behavior by checking which processes are consuming the most resources. Dive in and identify the top CPU consumers!

---

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%CPU
```

🤔 Question:

Which command would you use to display only the top 5 processes consuming the most CPU resources?

🔘 a) `ps aux --sort=-%CPU | head -n 5` 🔘 b) `ps aux --sort=-%CPU | tail -n 5` 🔘 c) `ps aux --sort=-%CPU | awk 'NR<=5'` 🔘 d) `ps aux --sort=-%CPU | grep -m 5`

💡 Hint: Familiarity with Linux command-line tools will help you filter the desired output effectively.
