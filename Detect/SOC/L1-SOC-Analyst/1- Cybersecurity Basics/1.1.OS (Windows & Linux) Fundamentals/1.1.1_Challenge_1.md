# **Challenge 1: Investigating Windows System Patches**

---

### **Description:**

🔍 As a Level 1 SOC Analyst, you have been tasked with investigating a potentially compromised Windows system. You want to review the installed patches to see if the system has been patched against a known vulnerability. The command to list the installed patches is:

```bash
wmic qfe
```

🤔 Question:

Which command would you use to filter the output to show only patches related to a specific vulnerability with the ID 'KB123456'?

🔘 a) ```wmic qfe | findstr "KB123456"``` 🔘 b) ```wmic qfe | grep "KB123456"``` 🔘 c) ```wmic qfe | awk '/KB123456/'``` 🔘 d) ```wmic qfe list installed | find "KB123456"```

💡 Hint: Think about the common commands used on a Windows system to filter output.
