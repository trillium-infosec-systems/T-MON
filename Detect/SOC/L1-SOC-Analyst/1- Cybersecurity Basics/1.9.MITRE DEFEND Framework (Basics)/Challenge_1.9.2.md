---

### **description:**

🔍 You are a Level 1 SOC Analyst and have been tasked with investigating an incident where an attacker used a keylogger to steal sensitive information. You must recommend a MITRE DEFEND control to prevent similar incidents in the future. Consider the following MITRE DEFEND controls:

---
```plaintext
D1.0 - Device and Network Hardening
  D1.1 - Device Configuration
  D1.2 - Network Configuration
  D1.3 - Network Segmentation
  D1.4 - Network Access Control
  D1.5 - Perimeter Defense
  D1.6 - Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems

D4.0 - Endpoint Security
  D4.1 - Host-Based Firewall
  D4.2 - Host-Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
  D4.3 - Antivirus and Antimalware
  D4.4 - Application Whitelisting and Control
  D4.5 - Patch Management
  D4.6 - Host Hardening
  D4.7 - Secure Configuration Management
```
🤔 Question:

Which control should you recommend to prevent keyloggers from compromising sensitive information?

🔘 ```A. D1.5 - Perimeter Defense```

🔘 ```B. D4.3 - Antivirus and Antimalware```

🔘 ```C. D4.4 - Application Whitelisting and Control```

🔘 ```D. D4.6 - Host Hardening```

💡 Hint: Consider the control that prevents unauthorized applications, like keyloggers, from running on endpoints to steal sensitive information.
