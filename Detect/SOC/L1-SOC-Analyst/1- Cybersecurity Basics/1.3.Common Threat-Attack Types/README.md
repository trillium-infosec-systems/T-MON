# 1.3 Common Threat/Attack Types

## Introduction
In the role of a Level 1 SOC Analyst, understanding common threat and attack types is crucial. This knowledge allows analysts to identify, analyze, and respond to various cyber threats effectively. This module offers challenges focused on different cyber threats and attacks, providing insights to equip you with the skills necessary to tackle such threats.

## Objectives
- Understand and differentiate between various cyber threats and attack types.
- Analyze real-world scenarios involving threats and attacks and deduce appropriate responses.
- Enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills pertaining to cybersecurity incidents.

## Challenges
Engage with the following challenges to test and deepen your understanding of common threat and attack types. Aim to solve them without looking at the solutions for a genuine learning experience.

1. [Investigating a potential phishing attack](./1.3.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Analyzing an email with a suspicious attachment](./1.3.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Reviewing firewall logs for a potential DDoS attack](./1.3.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Analyzing an email from a trusted source with a suspicious attachment](./1.3.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Responding to a report of a compromised user database](./1.3.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges cover a broad range of threats and attack types, the world of cyber threats is vast and continuously evolving. Ensure to stay updated with the latest threat trends, attack techniques, and mitigation strategies. Regularly engage with cybersecurity news platforms, forums, and communities to stay informed.

## Reproducing Challenges
For practical exposure:

- Set up a virtual environment, perhaps using platforms like VirtualBox or VMware.
- Engage with platforms like `GoPhish` to simulate phishing scenarios.
- Use platforms like DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) to understand and test various web vulnerabilities.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups:

- **General Tools**:
  - Explore platforms like `CyberRange` and `Hack The Box` for hands-on challenges.
  - Familiarize yourself with threat intelligence platforms like `AlienVault OTX` and `ThreatConnect`.

- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - For phishing: Explore tools like `GoPhish`.
  - For web vulnerabilities: Engage with platforms like `DVWA` and `OWASP WebGoat`.
