# **Challenge 3: Recognizing DDoS Indicators**

---

### **Description:**

🔍 As a Level 1 SOC Analyst, you are reviewing firewall logs to investigate a potential DDoS attack targeting your organization's web server. You see the following log entries:

```yaml
2023-04-14 10:00:01 DROP TCP 192.0.2.123 203.0.113.1 1500 80
2023-04-14 10:00:01 DROP TCP 192.0.2.124 203.0.113.1 1500 80
2023-04-14 10:00:01 DROP TCP 192.0.2.125 203.0.113.1 1500 80
2023-04-14 10:00:01 DROP TCP 192.0.2.126 203.0.113.1 1500 80
```

🤔 Question:

Which type of DDoS attack is most likely being attempted based on these logs?

🔘 a) ```SYN flood```   
🔘 b) ```ICMP flood``` 
🔘 c) ```HTTP flood``` 
🔘 d) ```UDP flood```

💡 Hint: Check the type of packets being sent and the pattern of the traffic.
