# Knowledge of Common Vulnerabilities & OWASP

## Introduction
For an L1 SOC Analyst, understanding common vulnerabilities and the OWASP Top Ten is crucial. This knowledge equips analysts with the insights needed to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in web applications. This module delivers practical challenges centered on common vulnerabilities and the OWASP Top Ten. While the challenges provide extensive coverage, they're designed to instill the significance of this knowledge in an L1 SOC Analyst's routine tasks.

## Objectives
- Enhance your comprehension of common vulnerabilities and the OWASP Top Ten.
- Learn to interpret web application logs and network traffic to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Distinguish between benign and malicious web requests.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and deepen your understanding of common vulnerabilities and the OWASP Top Ten. For a genuine learning experience, try to resolve them without checking the answers.

1. [Interpreting suspicious web request patterns](./1.6.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Analyzing web logs to pinpoint potential vulnerabilities](./1.6.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Identifying SQL Injection attempts](./1.6.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Recognizing signs of path traversal attacks](./1.6.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Detecting attempts to exploit XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities](./1.6.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges offer an in-depth understanding of common vulnerabilities, the realm of web application security is vast and ever-evolving. Ensure to explore further into areas like:
- Different types of web application attacks and their mitigation.
- Secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Advanced web application firewall (WAF) configurations to block malicious requests.

## Reproducing Challenges
To delve deeper into these challenges:
- Set up a controlled lab environment with vulnerable web applications (like DVWA, WebGoat).
- Use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to intercept and analyze web requests.
- Attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in a safe and controlled manner to understand their impact.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups beyond the challenges:

- **General Tools**:
  - Familiarize yourself with web application security tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and sqlmap.
  - Explore online platforms like the OWASP WebGoat Project to practice exploiting vulnerabilities safely.

- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - Utilize platforms like VirusTotal or PayloadsAllTheThings on GitHub to understand different types of malicious payloads.
