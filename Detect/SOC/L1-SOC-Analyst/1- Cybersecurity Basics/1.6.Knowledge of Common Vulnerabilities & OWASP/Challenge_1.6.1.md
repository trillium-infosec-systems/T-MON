# **Challenge 1.6.1: Common Vulnerabilities & OWASP**

---

### **description:**

🔍 You are a Level 1 SOC Analyst at XYZ Corporation. While monitoring the web application logs, you notice an unusual pattern that could indicate a potential attack. The following log entries are observed:

---
```plaintext
GET /products?id=1234 HTTP/1.1
GET /products?id=1235 HTTP/1.1
GET /products?id=1236 HTTP/1.1
GET /products?id=1237 HTTP/1.1
GET /products?id=1238 HTTP/1.1
```
🤔 Question:

Based on the observed pattern, which OWASP Top Ten vulnerability might the attacker be attempting to exploit?

🔘 ```A1: Injection```

🔘 ```A2: Broken Authentication```

🔘 ```A3: Sensitive Data Exposure```

🔘 ```A4: Insecure Direct Object References```

💡 Hint: Focus on the nature of the requests and which OWASP vulnerability involves manipulating parameters.
