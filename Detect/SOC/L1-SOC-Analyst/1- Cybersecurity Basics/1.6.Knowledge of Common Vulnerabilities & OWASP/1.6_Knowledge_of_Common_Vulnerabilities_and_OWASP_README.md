# Knowledge of Common Vulnerabilities & OWASP

## Introduction
For an L1 SOC Analyst, understanding common vulnerabilities and the OWASP Top Ten is essential. This knowledge allows analysts to recognize signs of attempted or successful exploitation, ensuring rapid response to potential threats. This module offers practical challenges focused on the OWASP Top Ten and other common vulnerabilities. While the challenges are comprehensive, they're structured to emphasize the importance of this knowledge in an L1 SOC Analyst's daily responsibilities.

## Objectives
- Enhance your understanding of the OWASP Top Ten and other prevalent vulnerabilities.
- Interpret logs and requests to identify potential exploitation attempts.
- Recognize signs of various common attacks and understand their implications.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and deepen your understanding of common vulnerabilities and OWASP. For an authentic learning experience, aim to solve them without looking at the solutions.

1. [Identify OWASP Vulnerability from Web Logs](./1.6.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Recognize OWASP Vulnerability from Request](./1.6.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Determine SQL Injection Type from Log Entry](./1.6.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Identify Vulnerability from Directory Traversal Attempt](./1.6.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Recommend Mitigation for XXE Attack](./1.6.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges provide a broad understanding of the OWASP Top Ten and other vulnerabilities, the realm of cybersecurity is vast and ever-evolving. It's crucial to stay updated with:
- The latest additions or changes to the OWASP Top Ten.
- Emerging vulnerabilities and zero-days.
- Best practices for mitigating known vulnerabilities.

## Reproducing Challenges
To dive deeper into these challenges:
- Set up a controlled lab environment where you can recreate and analyze the vulnerabilities without risks.
- Use vulnerability scanning tools or platforms to identify weak points in applications or systems.
- Explore vulnerable systems or platforms designed for learning, such as DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups beyond the challenges:

- **General Tools**:
  - Familiarize yourself with platforms like OWASP Zap, Burp Suite, and Metasploit.
  - Explore online platforms that share details about known vulnerabilities, such as the NVD (National Vulnerability Database).

- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - Utilize platforms like DVWA or WebGoat to get hands-on experience with common vulnerabilities.

## Learning Resources
To guide your journey in understanding common vulnerabilities and OWASP, consider these resources:

- [OWASP Top Ten Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and Cybrary offer courses on web application security and common vulnerabilities.
