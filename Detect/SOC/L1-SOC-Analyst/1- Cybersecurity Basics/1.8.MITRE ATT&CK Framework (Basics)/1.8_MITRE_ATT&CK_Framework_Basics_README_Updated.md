# MITRE ATT&CK Framework (Basics)

## Introduction
For a Level 1 SOC Analyst, understanding the MITRE ATT&CK framework is crucial for categorizing and understanding the different techniques and tactics used by adversaries. This knowledge ensures a structured approach to threat hunting, detection, and response. The following challenges are designed to test your foundational knowledge of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Objectives
- Familiarize with basic techniques and tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Understand how different attacks can be categorized using the framework.
- Enhance your ability to use the framework for threat hunting and response.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and deepen your understanding of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. For an authentic learning experience, aim to solve them without peeking at the solutions.

1. [Understanding spear-phishing using MITRE ATT&CK](./1.8.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Identifying PowerShell techniques](./1.8.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Analyzing command and control scripts](./1.8.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Discovering remote services in binaries](./1.8.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Analyzing ingress tool transfers with PowerShell](./1.8.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges give you a basic understanding of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it's essential to delve deeper into the various tactics and techniques. Ensure to:

- Explore the entire MITRE ATT&CK matrix and understand the categorization.
- Understand how real-world incidents can be mapped to the framework.
- Familiarize with various tools and techniques adversaries use and how they fit into the ATT&CK matrix.

## Reproducing Challenges
To reproduce these challenges:

- Set up a controlled lab environment.
- Simulate the attacks or techniques mentioned in the challenges.
- Use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to categorize and understand the simulated attacks.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups:

- **General Tools**:
  - Explore the MITRE ATT&CK matrix online.
  - Use threat intelligence platforms that map data to the ATT&CK framework.
  
- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - Use tools or scripts that can simulate the attacks or techniques mentioned in the challenges.

## Learning Resources
