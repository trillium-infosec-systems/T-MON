# MITRE ATT&CK Framework (Basics)

## Introduction
For an L1 SOC Analyst, understanding the MITRE ATT&CK framework is essential. This framework provides a knowledge base of cyber adversary behavior and tactics, techniques, and procedures. Familiarity with this framework assists analysts in categorizing and responding to various types of cyber threats. This module offers challenges to evaluate your understanding of basic concepts within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Objectives
- Recognize various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Analyze scenarios to identify relevant TTPs based on observed behaviors.
- Apply the MITRE ATT&CK framework to real-world examples to identify potential threats.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and deepen your understanding of the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

1. [Analyzing a spear-phishing attack using MITRE ATT&CK](./1.8.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Identifying the ATT&CK technique from a PowerShell command](./1.8.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Categorizing a custom command and control script](./1.8.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Determining the technique from a suspicious binary](./1.8.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Recognizing the technique from a file transfer command](./1.8.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges provide a foundational understanding of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it's essential to delve deeper into the extensive knowledge base provided by MITRE:

- Explore the various tactics and techniques listed in the framework.
- Understand the real-world applications and examples associated with each technique.
- Familiarize yourself with the MITRE ATT&CK matrix and its categorization.

## Reproducing Challenges
To get the most out of these challenges:
- Set up a controlled lab environment to simulate and analyze various attack scenarios.
- Use tools and platforms that offer MITRE ATT&CK mapping to real-world incidents.
- Constantly update your knowledge as the MITRE ATT&CK framework is regularly updated with new findings.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups beyond the challenges:

- **General Tools**:
  - Familiarize yourself with platforms like ATT&CK Navigator, which helps visualize and analyze the MITRE ATT&CK matrix.
  - Engage with threat intelligence platforms that map their findings to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - Use platforms or tools that simulate various attack scenarios and provide mappings to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
