# SIEM Basics (Architecture & Workflow)

## Introduction
For a Level 1 SOC Analyst, understanding the basics of SIEM, its architecture, and workflow is crucial. SIEM, or Security Information and Event Management, is a comprehensive solution that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by various hardware and software infrastructure in an organization. This module presents challenges that focus on understanding SIEM's core concepts and functionalities. By engaging with these challenges, analysts can solidify their grasp on how SIEM systems operate and their role in a SOC.

## Objectives
- Grasp the fundamental concepts and components of SIEM.
- Understand the workflow and process of how SIEM systems analyze and correlate data.
- Learn to interpret and act on alerts generated by SIEM systems.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and deepen your understanding of SIEM basics, its architecture, and workflow. For an authentic learning experience, aim to solve them without peeking at the solutions.

1. [Understanding SIEM architecture components](./1.7.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Creating a correlation rule in SIEM](./1.7.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Analyzing logs for suspicious activity](./1.7.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Investigating SIEM alerts](./1.7.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Creating a SIEM dashboard for web application security](./1.7.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges provide foundational knowledge about SIEM, the world of SIEM is vast and intricate. Ensure to delve deeper into topics like:
- The different SIEM solutions available in the market and their unique features.
- Advanced correlation rule creation and fine-tuning.
- Integrating threat intelligence feeds with SIEM for enhanced threat detection.

## Reproducing Challenges
To get the most out of these challenges:
- Set up a controlled lab environment with a SIEM solution (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack).
- Simulate real-world scenarios by injecting logs and observing how the SIEM system reacts.
- Create custom correlation rules and monitor their efficiency.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups beyond the challenges:

- **General Tools**:
  - Familiarize yourself with popular SIEM solutions like Splunk, ELK Stack, and IBM QRadar.
  - Learn to use SIEM query languages, such as SPL (Search Processing Language) for Splunk.

- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - Use log generators and simulators to create real-world scenarios in your lab.
