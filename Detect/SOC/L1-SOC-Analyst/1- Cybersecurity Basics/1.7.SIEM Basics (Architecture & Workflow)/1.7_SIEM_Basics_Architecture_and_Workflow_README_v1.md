# SIEM Basics (Architecture & Workflow)

## Introduction
For a Level 1 SOC Analyst, understanding the basic architecture and workflow of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is crucial. This foundational knowledge allows analysts to efficiently manage and analyze security alerts, ensuring that potential threats are detected and responded to in a timely manner. This module offers practical challenges centered around the basics of SIEM. The challenges are designed to instill the importance of SIEM in an L1 SOC Analyst's daily responsibilities.

## Objectives
- Deepen your comprehension of SIEM architecture and its components.
- Enhance your ability to analyze alerts and logs in a SIEM system.
- Learn to create and manage correlation rules and dashboards in SIEM.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and enrich your understanding of SIEM basics. For a genuine learning experience, aim to solve them without consulting the solutions.

1. [Understanding SIEM Architecture Components](./1.7.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Identifying OWASP Top Ten Vulnerability from a Request](./1.7.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Analyzing Logs to Detect Suspicious Activity](./1.7.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Investigating an Alert Generated by SIEM](./1.7.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Creating a SIEM Dashboard for Web Application Security](./1.7.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges offer a broad understanding of SIEM basics, the world of SIEM is vast with many nuances. Aspects to explore further include:
- Advanced SIEM architectures and integration techniques.
- The difference between traditional SIEM and next-gen SIEM.
- How machine learning and AI are shaping the future of SIEM.

## Reproducing Challenges
To delve deeper into these challenges:
- Set up a controlled lab environment with a SIEM solution.
- Integrate different log sources into your SIEM and create custom correlation rules.
- Simulate different security scenarios and observe how your SIEM reacts.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Expand your toolkit and setups for a holistic understanding:

- **General Tools**:
  - Familiarize yourself with popular SIEM solutions like Splunk, ELK Stack, and IBM QRadar.
  - Engage with online SIEM communities to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices.
  
- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - Use log generators and simulators to produce realistic logs for SIEM ingestion.
