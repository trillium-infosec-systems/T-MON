# Incident Response Framework

## Introduction
Understanding the Incident Response Framework is pivotal for a Level 1 SOC Analyst. This section aims to challenge and enhance your knowledge about the structured approach that organizations adopt to handle and manage the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack.

## Objectives
- Grasp the essence of the Incident Response Process, especially the SANS Incident Response Process.
- Understand the importance and sequence of each step within the process.
- Handle simulated incidents efficiently by applying the learned process steps.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and enhance your understanding. Aim to solve them without looking at the solutions first for an authentic learning experience.

1. [Steps of SANS Incident Response Process](./1.2.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Missing Step in Incident Response](./1.2.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Logging during Incident Response](./1.2.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Post-Identification Steps in Incident Response](./1.2.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Sequence of Incident Response Steps](./1.2.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While the challenges provide a comprehensive overview of the Incident Response Framework, the real-world demands more. An L1 SOC Analyst should be aware of:
- Different frameworks available for incident response.
- The difference between major incident response steps across different frameworks.
- Best practices for each step in the response process.

## Reproducing Challenges
To gain a hands-on experience of the challenges:
- Set up a simulated environment mimicking an organizational network.
- Use platforms like THREATGEN or Cyberbit to simulate cybersecurity incidents.
- Apply the Incident Response Process steps to handle and manage these incidents.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups beyond the challenges:

- **General Tools**:
  - Platforms like THREATGEN, Cyberbit, and others that allow simulated cyber incident environments.
  - Documentation and guides on popular Incident Response Frameworks.
