# 1.2 Incident Response Framework

## Introduction
The role of an L1 SOC Analyst often involves responding to security incidents. Understanding the structured approach to incident response is vital. This module introduces the Incident Response Framework, equipping you with the knowledge and practical challenges to ensure efficient and effective responses to security threats.

## Objectives
- Familiarize with the stages of the Incident Response Framework.
- Understand the importance and sequence of each step in the framework.
- Enhance critical thinking and decision-making skills during security incidents.

## Challenges
Engage with the following challenges to solidify your understanding of the Incident Response Framework. Aim to solve them without looking at the solutions for a genuine learning experience.

1. [Understanding the containment step in the SANS Incident Response Process](./1.2.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Identifying the missing step in the incident response plan](./1.2.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Documenting evidence in the Incident Response Process](./1.2.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Determining the immediate step after incident identification](./1.2.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Recognizing the sequence of steps in the Incident Response Framework](./1.2.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges provide insights into the Incident Response Framework, it's essential to delve deeper into the nuances and real-world applications of each step. Regularly engage with cybersecurity news platforms and forums to stay updated on the latest incident response strategies and best practices.

## Reproducing Challenges
For hands-on experience:
- Create mock scenarios and practice incident response in a controlled environment.
- Use platforms like `CyberRange` to simulate security incidents and practice response strategies.
- Regularly review and update your organization's incident response plan.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
While the challenges focus on the theoretical understanding of the framework, practice with a variety of tools:
- **General Tools**:
  - Platforms like `CyberRange` and `Hack The Box` offer hands-on incident response challenges.
  - Familiarize with incident response platforms like `TheHive` and `MISP`.
  
- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - For phishing scenarios, tools like `GoPhish` can provide practical insights.
  - Platforms like `Mitre ATT&CK` offer insights into various attack techniques and corresponding response strategies.
