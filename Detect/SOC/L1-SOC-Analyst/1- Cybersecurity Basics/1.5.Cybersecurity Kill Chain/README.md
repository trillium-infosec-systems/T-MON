# Cybersecurity Kill Chain

## Introduction
The Cybersecurity Kill Chain is a structured framework that represents the stages of a cyber attack, from the initial reconnaissance to the final objective. Understanding each stage is essential for a Level 1 SOC Analyst to detect, prevent, and mitigate threats. This module dives deep into each step, highlighting the potential indicators of compromise and associated challenges.

## Objectives
- Understand the sequence and purpose of each stage in the Cybersecurity Kill Chain.
- Recognize typical tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with each stage.
- Identify potential indicators of compromise related to specific stages in the Kill Chain.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and enhance your understanding of the Cybersecurity Kill Chain:

1. [Cybersecurity Kill Chain - Phishing Attack](1.5.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Cybersecurity Kill Chain - Lateral Movement](1.5.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Cybersecurity Kill Chain - Suspicious Email Investigation](1.5.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Cybersecurity Kill Chain - Data Exfiltration](1.5.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Cybersecurity Kill Chain - Custom-built Payload Creation](1.5.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While the challenges focus primarily on recognizing the stages of the Kill Chain in different scenarios, a thorough understanding requires diving deeper. Consider exploring:

- Real-world case studies of notable cyber attacks and their stages.
- Advanced persistent threats (APTs) and their modus operandi in the context of the Kill Chain.
- The overlap and interplay between the stages of the Kill Chain.

## Reproducing Challenges
To immerse yourself in these challenges:
- Use platforms like MITRE ATT&CK to explore tactics and techniques linked with the Kill Chain.
- Analyze real-world logs and packet captures to identify traces of each stage.
- Simulate scenarios in a controlled environment to recognize attack patterns.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups to understand and detect the stages of the Cybersecurity Kill Chain:

- Platforms like MITRE ATT&CK provide a comprehensive overview of the tactics and techniques used by threat actors.
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools can help detect traces of attacks mapped to the Kill Chain.
- Packet analysis tools like Wireshark can help dissect network traffic to identify signs of different Kill Chain stages.
