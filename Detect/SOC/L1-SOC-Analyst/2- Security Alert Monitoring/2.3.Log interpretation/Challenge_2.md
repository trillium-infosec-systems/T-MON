# **Challenge 2: Log Interpretation**

---

### **description:**

🔍 You're analyzing logs as a Level 1 SOC Analyst when you find the following log entry:

---
```plaintext
[2023-04-14 17:30:00] VPN: src=203.0.113.1 dst=192.168.1.1 proto=TCP sport=59000 dport=1723 username="jsmith" status="Failed"
```
🤔 Question:

Which of the following actions should you take?

🔘 ```a) Ignore the log entry, as it is a normal VPN connection attempt```

🔘 ```b) Investigate further to determine if "jsmith" is a valid user```

🔘 ```c) Report the incident to higher-level analysts for further investigation```

🔘 ```d) Block the source IP address, as it indicates a potential brute-force attack```

💡 Hint: Consider the significance of the failed VPN connection attempt and the provided username.
