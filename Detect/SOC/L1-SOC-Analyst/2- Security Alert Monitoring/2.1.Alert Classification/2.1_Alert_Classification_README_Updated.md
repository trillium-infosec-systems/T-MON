# 2.1 Alert Classification

## Introduction
For an L1 SOC Analyst, correctly classifying security alerts is a fundamental skill. Accurate alert classification allows analysts to prioritize and respond to genuine security incidents efficiently, reducing false positives and ensuring threats are addressed promptly.

## Objectives
- Develop proficiency in interpreting and classifying security alerts.
- Understand the implications of various alert classifications.
- Distinguish between false positives, true positives, benign activities, and alerts that require further investigation.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and enhance your alert classification skills. Remember to solve them without referencing the solutions.

2. [Alert on DNS query to public resolver](./2.1.2_Challenge.md)
3. [Alert on internal FTP connection](./2.1.3_Challenge.md)
4. [Alert on possible SQL Injection](./2.1.4_Challenge.md)
5. [Alert on port scanning activity](./2.1.5_Challenge.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges introduce the basics of alert classification, there's more depth to this skill set in a real-world SOC environment:
- Understanding the context of the alert within the organization's environment.
- Familiarity with the organization's security policies and normal network behavior.
- Combining multiple alerts to identify larger attack patterns or campaigns.

## Reproducing Challenges
To delve deeper into alert classification:
- Set up a controlled lab environment where you can simulate security alerts.
- Use security tools and platforms that can generate real-world-like alerts.
- Regularly review and adjust alerting thresholds and rules to adapt to the changing threat landscape.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups for effective alert classification:

- **General Tools**:
  - Familiarize yourself with SIEM platforms like Splunk, ELK Stack, and QRadar.
  - Understand the intricacies of IDS/IPS alerting, such as those from Snort or Suricata.

- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - Use threat intelligence platforms to verify indicators of compromise (IoCs) present in alerts.

## Learning Resources
To master alert classification and become an efficient L1 SOC Analyst, consider these resources:

- Platforms like Coursera and Udemy offer courses on SIEM operations and alert management.
- Explore online forums and communities that discuss real-world alerts and interpretations.
