# 2.1 Alert Classification

## Introduction
For a Level 1 SOC Analyst, correctly classifying alerts is crucial. This ensures that potential security incidents are identified, prioritized, and responded to appropriately. This module presents challenges that focus on understanding how to classify alerts based on the information provided. While the challenges cover a wide range of scenarios, they're structured to emphasize the importance of this skill in an L1 SOC Analyst's daily tasks.

## Objectives
- Enhance your ability to correctly classify alerts based on their content.
- Understand the difference between false positives, true positives, and other classifications.
- Prioritize alerts based on their potential security impact.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and deepen your understanding of alert classifications. For a genuine learning experience, try to solve them without referencing the solutions.

1. [Classifying a potential C2 communication alert](./2.1.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Classifying an alert indicating a DNS query to a public resolver](./2.1.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Classifying an alert related to FTP communication between internal hosts](./2.1.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Classifying an alert indicating possible SQL injection](./2.1.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Classifying an alert suggesting port scanning activity](./2.1.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges provide an understanding of alert classification, there's always more to learn in the dynamic world of cybersecurity. Consider exploring:
- The intricacies of advanced persistent threats (APTs) and their alert patterns.
- How machine learning and artificial intelligence are being used to automate alert classification.
- The role of threat intelligence in enhancing alert classification.

## Reproducing Challenges
To delve into these challenges:
- Set up a controlled environment with tools like Security Onion or ELK Stack.
- Simulate different types of network traffic and security events.
- Utilize threat intelligence feeds to generate realistic alerts.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups beyond these challenges:

- **General Tools**:
  - Master SIEM solutions like Splunk, ELK Stack, and QRadar.
  - Familiarize yourself with threat intelligence platforms like MISP or ThreatConnect.

- **Challenge-specific Tools**:
  - Use tools like tcpdump or Zeek (Bro) to generate and analyze network traffic.
