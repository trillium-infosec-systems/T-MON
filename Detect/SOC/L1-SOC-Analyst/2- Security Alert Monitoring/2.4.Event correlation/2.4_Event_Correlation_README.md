# 2.4 Event Correlation

## Introduction
For an L1 SOC Analyst, the ability to correlate events is essential. By linking related security events from different sources, analysts can gain a clearer understanding of an incident's context, scope, and potential impact. This module offers challenges that test the analyst's aptitude in correlating various events to draw meaningful conclusions. Though these challenges are designed to be comprehensive, they emphasize the significance of event correlation in the daily duties of an L1 SOC Analyst.

## Objectives
- Develop skills to correlate different security events and identify patterns.
- Understand the importance of context in analyzing security incidents.
- Differentiate between isolated events and coordinated attack patterns.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to test and deepen your understanding of event correlation. To maximize learning, try to solve them without looking at the answers.

1. [Understanding related security events](./2.4.1_Challenge_1.md)
2. [Analyzing correlated logs for potential threats](./2.4.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Identifying impossible travel scenarios](./2.4.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Reviewing events for signs of command and control communication](./2.4.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Detecting potential data breaches through event correlation](./2.4.5_Challenge_5.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges provide a thorough understanding of event correlation, the world of security event management is vast and complex. It's beneficial to explore topics like:
- The workings of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms.
- Advanced correlation techniques used in large-scale environments.
- The importance of time synchronization in event correlation.

## Reproducing Challenges
To delve into these challenges:
- Set up a SIEM platform in a lab environment to practice event correlation.
- Use realistic log data, or generate your own, to create correlation scenarios.
- Simulate multi-stage attacks and try to correlate the events they generate.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Enhance your toolkit and setups:

- **General Tools**:
  - Master SIEM platforms like Splunk, ELK Stack, or IBM QRadar.
  - Use log generators to create realistic datasets for correlation exercises.

- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - Tools like MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) can be used to correlate events with known threat indicators.
