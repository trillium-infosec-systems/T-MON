No.     Time        Source                Destination           Protocol Length Info
  1 0.000000    192.168.1.102         8.8.8.8               DNS      76     Standard query 0x1234 A example.com
  2 0.000250    8.8.8.8               192.168.1.102         DNS      92     Standard query response 0x1234 A 93.184.216.34
  3 0.000300    192.168.1.102         8.8.8.8               DNS      76     Standard query 0x1235 A example.org
  4 0.000550    8.8.8.8               192.168.1.102         DNS      92     Standard query response 0x1235 A 198.51.100.3
```

🤔 Question:

What might be the reason for this sudden spike in DNS requests?

🔘 a) ```A user is visiting multiple websites``` 🔘 b) ```A malware infection attempting to connect to its Command and Control (C2) server``` 🔘 c) ```A misconfiguration in the DNS resolver``` 🔘 d) ```A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack```

💡 Hint: While there could be multiple reasons, think about the patterns of malicious actors.
