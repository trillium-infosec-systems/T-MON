# 2.2 Real-time Monitoring

## Introduction
For an L1 SOC Analyst, real-time monitoring is pivotal in ensuring the security of an organization's digital assets. By constantly observing and analyzing network traffic, analysts can promptly detect and respond to potential threats. This module furnishes challenges that hone the skills required for effective real-time monitoring.

## Objectives
- Develop proficiency in analyzing real-time logs and network traffic.
- Understand the significance of various log entries and their implications.
- Distinguish between normal and anomalous network behaviors.

## Challenges
1. [Monitoring Real-time Logs for Suspicious Activity](./2.2.1_Monitoring_Real-time_Logs.md)
2. [Analyzing Network Traffic Round-trip Time](./2.2.2_Analyzing_Network_Traffic.md)
3. [Investigating Sudden Spike in DNS Requests](./2.2.3_Investigating_DNS_Spike.md)
4. [Detecting Potential SQL Injection Attacks](./2.2.4_Detecting_SQL_Injection.md)
5. [Monitoring Traffic with a Web Application Firewall](./2.2.5_Monitoring_with_WAF.md)
6. [Identifying Port Scanning Activity](./2.2.6_Identifying_Port_Scanning.md)
7. [Analyzing Multiple DNS Queries](./2.2.7_Analyzing_Multiple_DNS_Queries.md)
8. [Detecting Use of Outdated Protocols](./2.2.8_Detecting_Outdated_Protocols.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
While these challenges cover a vast spectrum of real-time monitoring scenarios, it's imperative to explore deeper realms of network monitoring. This includes:
- Understanding various log formats and their significance.
- Familiarizing oneself with advanced network monitoring tools.
- Recognizing patterns that typically indicate breaches or attacks.

## Reproducing Challenges
To get the most out of these challenges:
- Set up a controlled lab environment to simulate real-time network traffic.
- Utilize tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and various IDS/IPS solutions.
- Constantly challenge yourself by introducing new and complex network scenarios.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups beyond the challenges:
- **General Tools**:
  - Become adept with Wireshark, tcpdump, and IDS/IPS solutions.
  - Explore SIEM solutions to understand large-scale real-time monitoring.

- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - Make use of online platforms and sandboxes to safely analyze suspicious URLs or files.
