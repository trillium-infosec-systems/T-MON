# 2.2 Real-time Monitoring

## Introduction
For a Level 1 SOC Analyst, real-time monitoring of network and system activities is crucial. This enables the identification of unusual patterns or potential threats in a timely manner. This module offers challenges related to real-time monitoring to enhance the analytical skills required for a SOC Analyst.

## Objectives
- Understand the significance of real-time monitoring and its role in threat detection.
- Analyze log entries to detect suspicious or anomalous activities.
- Classify and respond to alerts based on their severity and potential impact.

## Challenges
Engage with these challenges to hone your skills in real-time monitoring. Always aim to determine the best course of action based on the information provided.

2. [Investigating a DNS query to a public resolver](./2.2.2_Challenge_2.md)
3. [Reviewing internal FTP communication](./2.2.3_Challenge_3.md)
4. [Detecting potential SQL injection attack](./2.2.4_Challenge_4.md)
5. [Identifying potential port scanning activity](./2.2.5_Challenge_5.md)
6. [Analyzing multiple DNS requests](./2.2.6_Challenge_6.md)
7. [Evaluating the use of an outdated protocol](./2.2.7_Challenge_7.md)
8. [Responding to potential ransomware attack indicators](./2.2.8_Challenge_8.md)

## Learning & Introducing New Concepts
Real-time monitoring not only involves identifying threats but also understanding the nature and characteristics of network and system activities. Analysts should be aware of:
- Different types of log entries and their significance.
- Common network protocols and their typical behaviors.
- The distinction between benign and potentially harmful traffic patterns.

## Reproducing Challenges
To delve deeper into these challenges:
- Set up a controlled lab environment to simulate different network scenarios.
- Use monitoring tools to capture real-time traffic and analyze logs.
- Create scenarios to mimic genuine network behaviors and malicious activities.

## Tools, Setups, and Configurations
Broaden your toolkit and setups for effective real-time monitoring:

- **General Tools**:
  - Utilize monitoring tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and IDS/IPS systems.
  - Familiarize yourself with SIEM platforms to aggregate and analyze log data.

- **Challenge-specific Tools**: 
  - Use platforms like Snort or Suricata to generate and analyze IDS logs.
  - Simulate malicious activities using penetration testing tools to understand their indicators.

## Learning Resources
To aid your journey in mastering real-time monitoring, consider these resources:

- [Wireshark Documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/)
- [Snort IDS Documentation](https://www.snort.org/documents)
- Platforms like Coursera and Udemy offer courses focused on network monitoring and intrusion detection.
