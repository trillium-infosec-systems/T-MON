Adversaries may deploy rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections,
services, drivers, and other system components. Rootkits are programs that hide the existence
of malware by intercepting and modifying operating-system API calls that supply system 
information. Rootkits or rootkit-enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level
in the operating system, or lower. Firmware rootkits that affect the operating system yield 
nearly full control of the system. While firmware rootkits are normally developed for the main
processing board, they can also be developed for I/O that can be attached to the asset. 
Compromise of this firmware allows the modification of all of the process variables and 
functions the module engages in.
