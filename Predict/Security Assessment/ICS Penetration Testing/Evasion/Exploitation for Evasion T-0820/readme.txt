Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to take advantage of a programming error 
in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to evade 
detection. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent
security features.
Adversaries may have prior knowledge through Remote System Information Discovery about 
security features implemented on control devices. These device security features will likely 
be targeted directly for exploitation.
