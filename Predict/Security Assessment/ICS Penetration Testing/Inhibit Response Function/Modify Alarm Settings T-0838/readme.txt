In ICS environments, the adversary may have to use Alarm Suppression or contend with multiple alarms
and/or alarm propagation to achieve a specific goal to evade detection or prevent intended responses 
from occurring.2 Methods of suppression often rely on modification of alarm settings, such as 
modifying in memory code to fixed values or tampering with assembly level instruction code.
