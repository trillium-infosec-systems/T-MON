Adversaries may forcibly restart or shutdown a device in an ICS environment to disrupt and
potentially negatively impact physical processes. Methods of device restart and shutdown 
exist in some devices as built-in, standard functionalities. These functionalities can be
executed using interactive device web interfaces, CLIs, and network protocol commands.
