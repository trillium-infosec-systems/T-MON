ID:		T0878
Tactic:		Inhibit Response Function
Asset:		Field Controller/RTU/PLC/IED, Safety Instrumented System/Protection Relay

Adversaries may target protection function alarms to prevent them from notifying operators 
of critical conditions. Alarm messages may be a part of an overall reporting system and of 
particular interest for adversaries.

Methods of suppression may involve tampering or altering device displays and logs, modifying
in memory code to fixed values, or even tampering with assembly level instruction code.
