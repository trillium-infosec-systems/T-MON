Adversaries may gather information about a PLC’s or controller’s current 
operating mode. Operating modes dictate what change or maintenance functions
can be manipulated and are often controlled by a key switch on the PLC 
(e.g., run, prog [program], and remote). Knowledge of these states may be 
valuable to an adversary to determine if they are able to reprogram the PLC.
