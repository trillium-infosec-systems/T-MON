Adversaries may attempt to upload a program from a PLC to gather information about an 
industrial process. Uploading a program may allow them to acquire and study the underlying 
logic. Methods of program upload include vendor software, which enables the user to upload
and read a program running on a PLC. This software can be used to upload the target program 
to a workstation, jump box, or an interfacing device.
