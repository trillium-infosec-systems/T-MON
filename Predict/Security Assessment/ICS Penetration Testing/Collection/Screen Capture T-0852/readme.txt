Adversaries may attempt to perform screen capture of devices in the 
control system environment. Screenshots may be taken of workstations, 
HMIs, or other devices that display environment-relevant process, 
device, reporting, alarm, or related data. These device displays may 
reveal information regarding the ICS process, layout, control, and 
related schematics. In particular, an HMI can provide a lot of 
important industrial process information.
Analysis of screen captures may provide the adversary with an 
understanding of intended operations and interactions between 
critical devices.
