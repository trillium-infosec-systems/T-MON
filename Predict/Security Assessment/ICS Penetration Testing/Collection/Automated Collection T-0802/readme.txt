Adversaries may automate collection of industrial environment information using tools 
or scripts. This automated collection may leverage native control protocols and tools 
available in the control systems environment. For example, the OPC protocol may be 
used to enumerate and gather information. Access to a system or interface with these 
native protocols may allow collection and enumeration of other attached, communicating
servers and devices.
