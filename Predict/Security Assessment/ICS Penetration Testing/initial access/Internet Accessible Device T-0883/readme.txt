Adversaries may gain access into industrial environments through systems 
exposed directly to the internet for remote access rather than through 
External Remote Services. Internet Accessible Devices are exposed to the 
internet unintentionally or intentionally without adequate protections. 
This may allow for adversaries to move directly into the control system 
network. Access onto these devices is accomplished without the use of 
exploits, these would be represented within the Exploit Public-Facing 
Application technique.
