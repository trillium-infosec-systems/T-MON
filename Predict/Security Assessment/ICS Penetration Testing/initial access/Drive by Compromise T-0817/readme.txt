Adversaries may gain access to a system during a drive-by compromise, when a user visits 
a website as part of a regular browsing session.With this technique, the user's web browser
is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website.
The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or 
other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted
attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering 
hole attack.
