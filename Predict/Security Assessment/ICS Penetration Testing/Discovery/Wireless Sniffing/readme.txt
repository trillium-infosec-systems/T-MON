	Wireless Sniffing

Technique ID:	T0887
Tactic:		Discovery, Collection

Adversaries may capture RF communications by using specialized hardware, 
such as software defined radio (SDR), handheld radio, or a computer with 
radio demodulator tuned to the communication frequency. Information 
transmitted over a wireless medium may be captured in-transit whether the 
sniffing device is the intended destination or not. This technique may be 
particularly useful to an adversary when the communications are not 
encrypted.
