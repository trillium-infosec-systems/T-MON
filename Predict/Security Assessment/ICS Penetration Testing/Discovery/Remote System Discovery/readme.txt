Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other 
logical identifier on a network that may be used for subsequent Lateral Movement or Discovery 
techniques. Functionality could exist within adversary tools to enable this, but utilities 
available on the operating system or vendor software could also be used.
