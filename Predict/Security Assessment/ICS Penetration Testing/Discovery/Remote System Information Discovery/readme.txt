	Remote System Information Discovery
Technique ID:	T0888
Tactic:		Discovery
Asset:		Field Controller/RTU/PLC/IED, Safety Instrumented System/Protection Relay

An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about remote systems and their peripherals, 
such as make/model, role, and configuration. Adversaries may use information from Remote System 
Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the 
system’s operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for 
the adversary’s operational objectives. In addition, the system’s configuration may be used to 
scope subsequent technique usage.
