Adversaries may spoof reporting messages in control system environments for evasion 
and to impair process control. In control systems, reporting messages contain 
telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment 
and the industrial process. Reporting messages are important for monitoring the 
normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations 
from expected values.
