Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using credential access techniques. 
In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials 
may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even 
be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary 
increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network.
