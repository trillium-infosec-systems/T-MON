Tactic:		Privilege Escalation
Asset:		Human-Machine Interface, Safety Instrumented System/Protection Relay

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges. 
Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of 
a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or 
kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission
levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries
will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to 
circumvent those restrictions
