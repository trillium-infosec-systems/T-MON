Adversaries may establish command and control capabilities over commonly used 
application layer protocols such as HTTP(S), OPC, RDP, telnet, DNP3, and modbus. 
These protocols may be used to disguise adversary actions as being network 
traffic. Standard protocols may be seen on their associated port or in some 
cases over a non-standard port.
Adversaries may use these protocols to reach out of the network for command and 
control, or in some cases to other infected devices within the network.
