Adversaries may cause a denial of control to temporarily prevent operators and engineers from 
interacting with process controls. An adversary may attempt to deny process control access to 
cause a temporary loss of communication with the control device or to prevent operator 
adjustment of process controls. An affected process may still be operating during the period 
of control loss, but not necessarily in a desired state
