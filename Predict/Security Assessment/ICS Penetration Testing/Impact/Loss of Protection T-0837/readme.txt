Adversaries may compromise protective system functions designed to prevent the effects 
of faults and abnormal conditions. This can result in equipment damage, prolonged process 
disruptions and hazards to personnel.
Many faults and abnormal conditions in process control happen too quickly for a human 
operator to react to. Speed is critical in correcting these conditions to limit serious 
impacts such as Loss of Control and Property Damage.
