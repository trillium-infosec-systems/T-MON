Tactic:		Impact

Adversaries may cause damage and destruction of property to infrastructure, equipment, 
and the surrounding environment when attacking control systems. This technique may 
result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage 
from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage 
and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in 
Loss of Safety. Operations that result in Loss of Control may also cause damage to 
property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause
impact in the form of Loss of Productivity and Revenue.
