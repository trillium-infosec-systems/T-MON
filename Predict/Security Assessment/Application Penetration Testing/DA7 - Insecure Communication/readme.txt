Insecure communication issues include usage of weak TLS or DTLS cipher-suites/protocols, 
plaintext database connections, usage of plaintext communication protocols such as HTTP, 
COAP, MQTT,etc. These flaws allow an attacker to perform MiTM attacks in order to sniff 
and manipulate the data of an active connection.
