	Software Based Attacks

Software-based attacks target the brains of the system — the application that manages
the devices.A successful attack on software allows a hacker to access data or gain 
control over an embedded system.
Searching for vulnerabilities in software design and code is the most popular vector 
of attack because it’s possible to conduct such an attack remotely.
