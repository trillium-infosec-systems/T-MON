	Malware Attacks
Malware attacks on embedded systems work the same way as with any other system.
a hacker deploys a piece of malicious code that tries to intercept the data 
stored inside the system, take control over the victim system, or harm it. 
Usually, hackers fake firmware updates, drivers, or security patches to deliver 
malware.
