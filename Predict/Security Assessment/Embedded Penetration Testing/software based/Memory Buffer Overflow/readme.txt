
	Memory Buffer Oveflow
Memory buffer overflow is a type of attack when hackers manually overflow 
the buffer of memory allocated to contain data that moves inside an 
embedded system. Hackers deploy exploits that swamp the memory buffer with 
too much data. In this case, the embedded operating system will record some 
of that data to memory sections located next to the buffer. Recorded data 
may contain shellcode or other exploits that help hackers obtain credentials 
and elevate their access rights.
