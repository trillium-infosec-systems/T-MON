	Brute forcing
Brute-forcing access credentials is, to put it simply, the process 
of guessing them. Most embedded systems provide remote access to a 
graphical user interface (GUI) that hackers can exploit. You can 
prevent brute-forcing attacks by using strong passwords and limiting 
the number of login attempts.
