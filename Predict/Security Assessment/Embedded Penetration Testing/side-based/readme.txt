	Side-Channel attacks

Side-channel attacks intend to use hardware security flaws in embedded systems to hack them. 
A side-channel attack is the hardest and most expensive type of attack, as it requires 
precise knowledge of the hardware design and physical availability of the target system. 
To carry out a side-channel attack, hackers gather information on system power consumption, 
electromagnetic leakage, operation timing, etc.
As a result, they may work out the internal operation of a system and connected devices, 
steal cryptographic keys, or even gain control over the system.
