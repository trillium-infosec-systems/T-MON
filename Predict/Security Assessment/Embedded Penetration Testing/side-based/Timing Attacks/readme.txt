		Timing Attacks
Timing attacks are based on the timing of embedded system operations. Theyâ€™re used to 
gain information such as applied cryptographic algorithms, data-dependent differences 
in instruction times and code branches, cache access times, and more. This type of 
attack also requires physical access to a device and deep knowledge of embedded system 
architectures.
