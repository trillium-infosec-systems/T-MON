		Electro-Magnetic Analysis

Electromagnetic analysis provides hackers another way to look inside embedded 
software without hacking it. Hackers can use electromagnetic analysis to record 
and analyze emissions from a device, figure out its cryptographic operations, 
and even extract secret keys. This is the most time-consuming and costly type 
of attack.
