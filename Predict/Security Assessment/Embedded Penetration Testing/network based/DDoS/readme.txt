		DDoS

DDoS is a well-known attack that makes a system unavailable by overflowing 
it with requests from various sources. Such attacks are hard to stop because 
requests come from a vast number of IPs. There’s no universal protection 
against DDoS attacks. However, adding a firewall along with traffic analysis 
and filtering algorithms to your embedded software will greatly increase the 
chances of preventing DDoS attacks or detecting them in a timely manner.
