		Signal Jaming

Signal jamming is common for wireless networks. With this technique, hackers create 
interference in the network to jam or distort communication from a device. Depending 
on the type of jammer, it can jam any communication on the channel, start working 
when a targeted device transmits data, or be activated upon detection of specific 
packets. Such an attack can make an embedded system unavailable.
