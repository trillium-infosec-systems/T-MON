		DNS Poisoning
DNS poisoning forces a local DNS server to modify its records according to a 
hacker’s needs. A DNS server converts human-memorable domain names and hostnames 
into corresponding IP addresses. By using a DNS server’s vulnerabilities and 
poisoning its cache, hackers can reroute traffic from a targeted website to 
any other address.
