		Man in the middle attack
An MITM attack is used to intercept or alter data transmitted by an embedded system. 
To execute it, hackers change the connection parameters of two devices in order to 
place a third one between them. If hackers can obtain or alter the cryptographic keys 
used by both devices, they can eavesdrop in a way thatâ€™s very hard to detect as it 
causes no disruption in the network.
