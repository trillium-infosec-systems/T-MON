		Session Hijacking

Session hijacking is similar to an MITM attack but has a different goal, the hacker listens 
to embedded system traffic to obtain authentication credentials. There are various ways to 
execute hijacking: fixating a user session identifier, stealing a session cache, cross-site 
scripting, and more.
