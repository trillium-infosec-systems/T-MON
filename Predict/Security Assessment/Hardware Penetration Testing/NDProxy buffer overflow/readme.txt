		NDProxy buffer overflow
This is an escalated privilege vulnerability that affects the Remote Access 
and Routing NDProxy component of the Windows kernel. The usual cause is the 
incorrect validation of commands passed from user mode to the kernel mode. 
Adversaries could utilize it to execute code with escalated privileges and 
gain full control over a target system. They could then view, change or 
delete data, as well as install malicious programs on the machine.
