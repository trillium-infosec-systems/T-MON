	Foreshadow
Foreshadow is an execution-related vulnerability that affects Intel CPUs. 
Hackers use it to extract sensitive data from the CPUs’ L1 data cache, 
which is accessible to all processor cores. An adversary could utilize 
the loopholes to read any information present in the cache, including 
protected data associated with the SMM (System Management Mode), the OS’s 
kernel or with other virtual machines managed by external cloud providers.
