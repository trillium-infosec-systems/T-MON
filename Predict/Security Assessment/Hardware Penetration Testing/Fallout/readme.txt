	Fallout
This is another speculative execution vulnerability that enables hackers 
to leak sensitive information across arbitrary protected boundaries on a 
target computer by, for instance, attacking data stored in the cloud or 
leaking it on malicious websites. This is done by exploiting the Micro
-architectural Data Sampling (MDS) side-channel loopholes in Intel CPUs. 
The vulnerability impacts both hypervisors and operating systems.
