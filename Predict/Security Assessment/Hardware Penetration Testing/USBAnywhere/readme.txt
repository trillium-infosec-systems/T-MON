		USBAnywhere
This is a collection of USB vulnerabilities that affect the BMC (baseboard 
management controller) on Supermicro’s server hardware. Hackers can use them 
to hijack thousands of server boards. The vulnerabilities include unauthenticated 
network traffic and plaintext authentication, an authentication bypass flaw and 
weak encryption for remote connections in X11 and X10 server boards that would 
enable new users on the virtual machine to utilize a previous user’s permissions.
