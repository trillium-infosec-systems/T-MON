		Screwed Drivers
According to researchers at Eclypsium, over 40 drivers from major BIOS 
vendors — including Huawei, Asus, Toshiba and NVIDIA — are susceptible 
to “screwed drivers” vulnerabilities. These are driver design flaws that 
enable hackers to escalate user privileges in order to access OS kernel 
models. The escalation opens and writes access to control registers (CR), 
model-specific registers (MSR), chipset I/O space, kernel and physical 
virtual memory.
