		SpectreRSB
Researchers at the University of California at Riverside discovered a side-channel 
vulnerability that manipulates a unique part of the speculative execution process 
known as the return stack buffer (RSB). RSB can be manipulated via user code and 
direct pollution, where an adversary can insert a call instruction as a value 
pushed to the software stack and the RSB. Specifically, the stack is manipulated 
to ensure the return address doesnâ€™t match the return buffer stack, allowing the 
bad actor to spoof data running on a CPU. The vulnerability may impact CPUs made 
by ARM, AMD and Intel.
