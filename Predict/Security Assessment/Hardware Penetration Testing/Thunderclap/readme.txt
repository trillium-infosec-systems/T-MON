		Thunderclap
Thunderclap is a collection of hardware vulnerabilities that reside in the 
Thunderbolt hardware interface produced by Intel. It can be used by hackers 
with physical access to a Thunderbolt port to overtake a target system in 
just a few seconds, executing arbitrary code at the highest level of 
privilege and gaining access to encryption keys, passwords, banking logins 
and other data.
