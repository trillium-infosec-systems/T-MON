		SWAPGS attack
Researchers at Bitdefender found a side-channel vulnerability that can be 
used against Intel CPUs and PCs running on them. Dubbed SWAPGS attack, the 
vulnerability is a novel side-channel exploit that benefits from the poorly 
documented behavior of SWAPGS, a system instruction that is used by the OS 
to switch between two “model-specific registers.” Hackers can use it to leak 
sensitive aspects of the kernel memory, including encryption keys and passwords.
