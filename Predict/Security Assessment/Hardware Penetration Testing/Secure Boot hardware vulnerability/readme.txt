		Secure Boot hardware vulnerability
Outdated variants of Secure Boot, Ciscoâ€™s trusted hardware root-of-trust, 
contain a bug that could enable a local hacker to compose a modified 
firmware image to a target component. Successful exploits could either 
result in the device becoming unusable or enable tampering with the 
verification process. The main reason behind the vulnerability is improper 
checks on the area of code that regulates on-premise installations to a 
FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), part of the Secure Boot implementation.
