		Flip Feng Shui (FFS)
This is an exploitation vector that enables a virtual machine of a malicious actor 
to flip a bit in a memory page of a targeted virtual machine that’s active and 
operating on the same host as the hacker’s VM. FFS utilizes the hardware vulnerability 
for flipping of bits and a “physical memory massaging” primitive to redirect a victim 
page on an at-risk physical memory base.
