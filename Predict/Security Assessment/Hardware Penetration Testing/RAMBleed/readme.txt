		RAMBleed
RAMBleed is a Rowhammer-type vulnerability that could allow hackers to 
potentially steal sensitive information from memory cells rather than 
simply modifying them. While conventional Rowhammer attacks are used to 
cause bits in adjacent memory rows to flip their values, RAMBleed attacks 
are used as a side-channel to infer details about and eventually extract 
information from neighboring memory cells.
