	Vulnerable and Outdated Components
it was previously titled Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities 
and is #2 in the Top 10 community survey, but also had enough data to 
make the Top 10 via data analysis. This category moves up from #9 in 
2017 and is a known issue that we struggle to test and assess risk. It 
is the only category not to have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures 
(CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploit and impact 
weights of 5.0 are factored into their scores.
