	Software and Data Integrity Failures
It is a new category for 2021, focusing on making assumptions related to 
software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying 
integrity. One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability 
and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data mapped 
to the 10 CWEs in this category. Insecure Deserialization from 2017 is 
now a part of this larger category.
