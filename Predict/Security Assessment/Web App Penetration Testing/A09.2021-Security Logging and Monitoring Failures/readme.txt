	Secuity Logging and Monitoring Failures
it was previously Insufficient Logging & Monitoring and is added from 
the industry survey (#3), moving up from #10 previously. This category 
is expanded to include more types of failures, is challenging to test 
for, and isn’t well represented in the CVE/CVSS data. However, failures 
in this category can directly impact visibility, incident alerting, and 
forensics.
