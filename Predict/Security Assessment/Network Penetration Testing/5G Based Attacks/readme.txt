		5G Based Attacks
5G-based attacks are a  more advanced form of network security threat. 
While 5G networks enable high-speed transfers of data, it also raises 
the risk of cyberattacks. Hackers are attacking multiple systems, 
mobiles, and IoT (Internet of Things) networks using 5G devices to 
deploy swarm-based network security attacks. The attacker can also 
make changes in real-time.
