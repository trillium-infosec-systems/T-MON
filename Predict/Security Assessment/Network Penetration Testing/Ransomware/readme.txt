		Ransomware
Ransomware is malicious software that hackers encrypt all files on 
target systems, networks, and servers. Other ransomware campaigns 
can gain access to a network and lock files until a ransom is paid 
in exchange for the decryption key by exploiting weak passwords and 
other vulnerabilities.
