	Phishing
Another common type of network security attack is phishing which is a 
form of social engineering attack. Cybercriminals trick users into 
clicking on a fraudulent email link or message which appears legitimate. 
So, when unsuspecting targets click the link, the malware is downloaded 
into their phones or systems, allowing the hackers to steal sensitive 
data or information such as credit card numbers or banking passwords.
