	Brute Force Attack
A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error 
to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys. It is 
a simple yet reliable tactic for gaining unauthorized access to 
individual accounts and organizationsâ€™ systems and networks. The 
hacker tries multiple usernames and passwords, often using a 
computer to test a wide range of combinations, until they find the 
correct login information.
