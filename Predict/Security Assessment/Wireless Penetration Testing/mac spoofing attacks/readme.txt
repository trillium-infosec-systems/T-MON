	MAC Spoofing

Every device that’s connected to a network possesses a worldwide, unique, 
and physical identification number: the Media Access Control address, or 
MAC for short. This burned-in address (BIA) is virtually etched to the 
hardware by the manufacturer. Users are not able to change or rewrite the 
MAC address. But it is possible to mask it on the software side. This 
masking is what’s referred to as MAC spoofing.
Reason:
MAC spoofing can be performed either for protecting privacy or it can be
performed for bypassing mac Filters on routers to gain access to network
and perform illegal activities.
