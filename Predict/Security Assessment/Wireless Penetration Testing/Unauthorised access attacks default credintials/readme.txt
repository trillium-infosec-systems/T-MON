	Default Credintial Attacks

A router with the default access credentials could grant malicious actors 
a foothold into your home network and even to the devices connected to it. 
Once they have their foot in the door, the cybercriminals could use the 
access to monitor what any device connected to the router is doing, what 
websites theyâ€™re browsing, and they could see any unencrypted data being 
sent over the network.
