	Man in the middle attacks
A man in the middle attack involves attackers intercepting traffic, 
either between your network and external sites or within your network. 
If communication protocols are not secured or attackers find a way 
to circumvent that security, they can steal data that is being 
transmitted, obtain user credentials and hijack their sessions.
