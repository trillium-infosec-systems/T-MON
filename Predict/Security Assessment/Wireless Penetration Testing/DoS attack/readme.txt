	Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack

A Denial-of-Service is an attack that shut down a machine or network 
and making it inaccessible to the users. It typically flooding a 
targeted system with requests until normal traffic is unable to be 
processed, resulting in denial-of-service to users.
It occurs when an attacker prevents legitimate users from accessing 
specific systems, devices or other network resources.
