		Client Code Quality
An attacker may pass crafted inputs to function calls made within an app in 
an attempt to execute them or observe the applicationâ€™s behavior. It may lead 
to degradation of performance, increased memory usage, etc. Note that the 
mistakes in code need to be fixed in a localized way since they arise on the 
mobile client and are different from server-side coding errors. There could be 
code-level mistakes in mobile apps that may lead to issues such as:

Format-string vulnerabilities,
Buffer overflows,
Integration with insecure third-party libraries,
Remote code execution
