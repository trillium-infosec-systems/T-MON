		Client Code Quality
An attacker may pass crafted inputs to function calls made within an app in 
an attempt to execute them or observe the application’s behavior. It may lead 
to degradation of performance, increased memory usage, etc. Note that the 
mistakes in code need to be fixed in a localized way since they arise on the 
mobile client and are different from server-side coding errors. There could be 
code-level mistakes in mobile apps that may lead to issues such as:

Format-string vulnerabilities,
Buffer overflows,
Integration with insecure third-party libraries,
Remote code execution
