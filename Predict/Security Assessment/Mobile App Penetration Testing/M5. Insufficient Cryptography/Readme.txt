There are two situations in which a system’s cryptography may get compromised to reveal sensitive data:
The underlying algorithm used for encryption and decryption might be weak, or
The cryptographic process itself has implementation flaws.
Broken cryptography in mobile apps can be the result of one of several factors.
This list of potential causes includes:

1. Bypassing built-in code encryption algorithms,
2. Improperly managing your digital keys, and
3. Using custom or deprecated encryption protocols.
