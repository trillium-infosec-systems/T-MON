An example of a modified app is where a hacker modifies the appâ€™s binary to include malicious content, 
install a backdoor, etc. Attackers can re-sign these counterfeit apps and publish the modified version 
onto third-party app stores. They can also deliver them to a victim directly via a phishing attack to 
trick them into downloading the app.
